"""
Code for all the shared Retuve Classes. This includes:

- Drawing Classes (Overlay)
- Metric Classes (2D and 3D)
- Segmentaition Classes
- Other (Recorded Error Class)

All classes except `retuve.classes.draw.Overlay` are built to act like
structs rather than classes. This means they do not have complex methods.
